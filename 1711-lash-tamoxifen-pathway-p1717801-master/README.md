It is the stated goal of this project to develop and maintain a [LEVEL-FIVE README](https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md) containing:

- Embedded visual aids like diagrams and demos.
- The build status identifies specific project aspects that are incomplete and/or causing instability.
- Clear information about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- One or more badges showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- Text updated at weekly or even daily intervals, so inaccuracies are unlikely.
