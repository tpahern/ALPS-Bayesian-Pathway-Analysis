# --- THE BIOREALM BASH SCRIPT TEMPLATE
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# --- General Bash Conventions
#
#    1. Quote your variables this way: "${ivar}" unless you're sure
#       it's an integer.
#    2. Use $(command) instead of backticks. Don't use backticks.
#    3. [[ ... ]] is preferred over [, test and /usr/bin/[.
#    4. Put ; do and ; then on the same line as the while, for or if.
#    5. Eval should be avoided.
#
# --- Commenting the script
#
# See the actual script template below, since it has built-in examples
# and instructions.
#
# --- Commenting functions
#
# Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented.
# Any function in a library must be commented regardless of length
# or complexity.
# It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
# program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
# (and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.
#
# All function comments should contain:
#
# Description of the function
# Global variables used and modified
# Arguments taken
# Returned values other than the default exit status of the last
# command run
#
# All other variables used in functions and in main should be local.
# Declaration and assignment should be on different lines.
#
# Example:
#
# Changes the owner of a given file
# Globals:
#   None
# Args:
#   $1 = The name of the file
#   $2 = The user name
#   $3 = The group name
# Returns:
#   None
#
# change_owner_of_file() {
#     local filename
#     local user
#     local group
#
#     filename=$1
#     user=$2
#     group=$3
#
#     chown $user:$group $filename
# }
#
# --- Commenting algorithms and code in general
#
# Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your code.
# Don't comment the obvious in algorithms, but if there's a complex
# algorithm or you're doing something out of the ordinary, put a
# short comment in.
