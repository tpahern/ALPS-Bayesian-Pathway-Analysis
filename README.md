## ALPS-Bayesian-Pathway-Analysis
A Jupyter Notebook illustrating application of the Algorithm for Learning Pathway Structure to complex pathway data.

## Quick start - no Jupyter installation required
Users who have yet to install Anaconda/Jupyter but would like a quick walk-through of applying ALPS should download "/notebooks/ALPS for time-to-event data.html" from this repository and open it with a web browser. This will provide a non-interactive view of the Jupyter Notebook's contents.

## CPSI grid
To initialize a CPSI grid with your own prior forest, see "cpsi.R" in the R subdirectory for instructions.
