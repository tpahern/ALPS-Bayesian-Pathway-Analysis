## ALPS-Bayesian-Pathway-Analysis
A Jupyter Notebook illustrating application of the Algorithm for Learning Pathway Structure to complex pathway data.

# Quick start - no Jupyter installation required
Users who have yet to install Anaconda/Jupyter but would like a quick walk-through of applying ALPS should download "1711-lash-tamoxifen-pathway-p1717801-master/notebooks/ALPS for time-to-event data.html" from this repository and open it with a web browser. This will provide a non-interactive view of the Jupyter Notebook's contents.
